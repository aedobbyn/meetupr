        &amp; R User Group Year-end Meetup</p> <p>To celebrate a wonderful year of
        #rstats learning and community, R-Ladies and the R User Group are coming together
        for a year-end social event.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to be watching The Computers
        documentary which tells the inspirational story of the women behind the ENIAC.</p>
        <p>In 1946 six brilliant young women programmed the first all-electronic,
        programmable computer, the ENIAC, a project run by the U.S. Army as part of
        a secret World War II project. They learned to program without programming
        languages or tools (for none existed) ̶ only logical diagrams. By the time
        they were finished, ENIAC ran a ballistics trajectory perfectly! Yet when
        the ENIAC was unveiled to the press and the public in 1946, the women were
        never introduced\u2026 and their story was lost for decades.</p> <p>*There
        will be secure parking available.</p> <p>DIRECTIONS<br/>Driving<br/>We have
        safe and secure underground parking at the building. The entrance can be found
        on the slip from Harrison st to Smit st. It is near impossible to access this
        entrance from Smit st in the evenings, so try to come down Harrison street.
        The entrance is labeled \"209 Smit Street Parking\". Drive down the ramp and
        you will be met by security who will direct you to the visitors parking. Take
        the lift to the ground floor and from there follow the signs to the Meetup.</p>
        <p>Gautrain &amp; Walking<br/>Braamfontein Gate is a 5-minute walk from Park
        Station. Ask Gautrain security for directions. Braamfontein Gate is the Uber
        pick up point for Park Station, so they should be able to point you in the
        right direction. Walk through the front doors and turn right. You''ll find
        us at the bottom of the stairs.</p> ","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1548141694000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258288077","name":"February

        science projects can go wrong in a million ways. To get it done well, you
        need to manage the expectations from day 0. How do you do this?</p> <p>This
        talk by Merelda Wu distills the art form of \"talking to business\" to a list
        of non-scientific formulas that can be applied in your everyday life.<br/>If
        any of the following resonates with you, join us:</p> <p>1. The magic wand
        problem? Data doesn\u2019t just give you \u201cactionable insight\u201d, you
        need to ask the right question.<br/>2. Misaligned expectations? The classic
        case of what you say you want, is not what you really, really want.<br/>3.
        The scope creep problem? Sure, of course I can re-write everything and give
        it to you five minutes ago.<br/>4. The big data problem? No darling, you don\u2019t
        have big data if it fits in Excel.<br/>5. The confidence challenge? No, there\u2019s
        no such thing as 100% accurate, also we use this thing called the F1 score.<br/>6.
        The cloud challenge? Yes cloud would be great, but your data''s gotta be there
        first though.</p> <p>This talk shares some common problems faced in most data
        science projects. Some heart-aching stories will be shared, as well as some
        great tools and tips that will help you speak to your business logically,
        with tons of visual aid and zero mathematical equations.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"rain,

        or scripts you received from a collaborator? You\u2019re not alone! Fortunately,
        there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible
        R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of
        non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility
        issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\"
        class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/</a>) to facilitate
        creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on
        and interactive, with small-group exercises.</p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants
        should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading
        a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from
        the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing
        these short guides before participating in the tutorial: [Introduction](<a

        &amp; R User Group Year-end Meetup</p> <p>To celebrate a wonderful year of
        #rstats learning and community, R-Ladies and the R User Group are coming together
        for a year-end social event.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to be watching The Computers
        documentary which tells the inspirational story of the women behind the ENIAC.</p>
        <p>In 1946 six brilliant young women programmed the first all-electronic,
        programmable computer, the ENIAC, a project run by the U.S. Army as part of
        a secret World War II project. They learned to program without programming
        languages or tools (for none existed) ̶ only logical diagrams. By the time
        they were finished, ENIAC ran a ballistics trajectory perfectly! Yet when
        the ENIAC was unveiled to the press and the public in 1946, the women were
        never introduced\u2026 and their story was lost for decades.</p> <p>*There
        will be secure parking available.</p> <p>DIRECTIONS<br/>Driving<br/>We have
        safe and secure underground parking at the building. The entrance can be found
        on the slip from Harrison st to Smit st. It is near impossible to access this
        entrance from Smit st in the evenings, so try to come down Harrison street.
        The entrance is labeled \"209 Smit Street Parking\". Drive down the ramp and
        you will be met by security who will direct you to the visitors parking. Take
        the lift to the ground floor and from there follow the signs to the Meetup.</p>
        <p>Gautrain &amp; Walking<br/>Braamfontein Gate is a 5-minute walk from Park
        Station. Ask Gautrain security for directions. Braamfontein Gate is the Uber
        pick up point for Park Station, so they should be able to point you in the
        right direction. Walk through the front doors and turn right. You''ll find
        us at the bottom of the stairs.</p> ","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1548141694000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258288077","name":"February

        science projects can go wrong in a million ways. To get it done well, you
        need to manage the expectations from day 0. How do you do this?</p> <p>This
        talk by Merelda Wu distills the art form of \"talking to business\" to a list
        of non-scientific formulas that can be applied in your everyday life.<br/>If
        any of the following resonates with you, join us:</p> <p>1. The magic wand
        problem? Data doesn\u2019t just give you \u201cactionable insight\u201d, you
        need to ask the right question.<br/>2. Misaligned expectations? The classic
        case of what you say you want, is not what you really, really want.<br/>3.
        The scope creep problem? Sure, of course I can re-write everything and give
        it to you five minutes ago.<br/>4. The big data problem? No darling, you don\u2019t
        have big data if it fits in Excel.<br/>5. The confidence challenge? No, there\u2019s
        no such thing as 100% accurate, also we use this thing called the F1 score.<br/>6.
        The cloud challenge? Yes cloud would be great, but your data''s gotta be there
        first though.</p> <p>This talk shares some common problems faced in most data
        science projects. Some heart-aching stories will be shared, as well as some
        great tools and tips that will help you speak to your business logically,
        with tons of visual aid and zero mathematical equations.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"rain,

        or scripts you received from a collaborator? You\u2019re not alone! Fortunately,
        there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible
        R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of
        non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility
        issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\"
        class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/</a>) to facilitate

        this month, for those who were unable to attend / did not get a ticket. The
        tutorial is valuable for everyone, but especially so for Masters and PhD students
        - if you know anyone who is busy with either of these, please encourage them
        to sign up on our group and RSVP :).</p> <p>Description:<br/>Have you ever
        struggled to re-run your own code or scripts you received from a collaborator?
        You\u2019re not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can
        use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will
        1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical
        experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr
        (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/</a>)
        to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial

        <p>- setting up a scientific Rmd blog with the Hugo website generator and
        the hugodown package (also quickly presenting blogdown)</p> <p>We''ll prepare
        for the adventures by defining what we expect of an Rmd blog. We''ll end the
        course by reflecting on each adventure as well as mentioning important future
        paths such as how to promote your blog. You should leave the course ready
